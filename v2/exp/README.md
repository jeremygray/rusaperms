# Experiments # 

In this folder we keep experimental work-in-progress that is not ready
to be committed as part of the actual perms map system, even as a
branch.  Typically it will not even be committed to the git
repository, but sometimes a longer running experiment may need to be
in the repo so that it can move more smoothly between machines,
platforms, or developers.  Usually it will be just a scratch area.
