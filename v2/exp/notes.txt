The following is not working: 

curl -v -0 -k -c cookies -F x='' -F login=5475 -F password="Mock Turtle" -F submit="log in"  https://rusa.org/cgi-bin/login_PF.pl





-0 is to try http version 1.0; didn't help
-v is for debugging; I can see where it gets stuck, 
  before sending the whole data
  
-k is for insecure connection, because rusa.org 
doesn't have all their certificates in order.
